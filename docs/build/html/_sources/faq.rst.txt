What types of products can be sold using Kiosk?
------------------------------------------------

Right now, only products that support instant delivery and anonymous buyers and sellers, which includes Ethereum-based assets (tokens, ENS domains, etc.) and other digital goods. This keeps the order logic very basic and removes the need to handle shipping information while Kiosk is still in development.

Why does Kiosk need its own token? Why canâ€™t buyers use Ether (ETH)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Kiosk Market Token enforces that markets function a certain way. It also ensures that all transactions using the Kiosk protocol rely on a single DIN Registry and Order Tracker.

In the future, Kiosk Market Token will allow holders to participate in decentralized governance to upgrade the Kiosk Market Token, DIN Registry, and Order Tracker contracts.
