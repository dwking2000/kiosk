# Kiosk

Kiosk is an e-commerce platform built on Ethereum.

## How Does It Work?

To sell a product, start by registering a Decentralized Identification Number (DIN) on the registry contract. DINs are global product identifiers like [UPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code), [EAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number), and [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number). The blockchain makes this registration process possible without a [centralized](https://www.gs1.org/barcodes) [recordkeeper](http://www.bowker.com/products/ISBN-US.html).

Then, add your product to a resolver contract. Resolver contracts are responsible for storing product information and processing orders.

Kiosk has a public resolver contract that anyone can use called PublicKiosk.

You can also use another resolver contract or create your own. Developers can earn tokens by creating public resolver contracts with innovative features like coupons, loyalty programs, inventory management, insurance, and more.

Finally, clients can create marketplaces with any products from the global registry and implement a checkout flow with only a few lines of code.
