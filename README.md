# Kiosk

Kiosk is a protocol for buying and selling products on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Overview

The blockchain has the potential to transform how we exchange goods and services. Early projects have shown innovative approaches for how buy and trade items in a trustless way. But most rely on application-specific smart contracts that are difficult to upgrade and reuse.

Kiosk provides a framework for creating decentralized marketplaces. Its smart contracts are building blocks that can be swapped in and out and reconfigured for many different markets.

* A `Product` has a unique 10-digit identifier, similar to a barcode
* A `Market` has a method called `buy` where buyers can purchase a product based on its identifier
* A `Market` stores `Products` and `Orders`
* A `Product` tells a `Market` its information, price, and availability
* A seller can withdraw proceeds from an `Order` when the `Market` has marked it as `Fulfilled`

Having a standardized approach for building on-chain markets can facilitate trust between buyers and sellers. With Kiosk, a buyer can figure out how much an item costs and how to buy it just by knowing its identifier. Sellers can manage pricing and inventory for multiple products and minimize blockchain transaction costs.

For developers, Kioskâ€™s protocol can provide a foundation to quickly build and launch new markets with a lower probability for error.

## How It Works

## Quick Start

Get started by testing locally with [TestRPC](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc).

Install project dependencies.

```
npm install
```

In a separate terminal tab, start TestRPC.

```
testrpc
```

Compile and deploy the Solidity contracts using [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/).

```
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```

Then, start the React project and open http://localhost:3000/ to see the app.

```
yarn start
```

## Testing

```
truffle test
```
